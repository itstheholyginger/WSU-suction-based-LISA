## Meeting Notes
add units to randvar column

c, c_r, phi = 1 significant dec
a, n = 3 sign
k_s = engineering notation 2 significant decimals

remove FS min and max if original doesn't have it

for FS: 3 decimals


## UI thoughts

#### DataForm
- split form into 2 sections side by side
  - one for randvars, one for everything else
  - use bootstrap to make ui look more sleek
  - use more borders. it looks too flat rn
  - make small boxes for each random variable?
