# To Do

<!-- - use Tasnia's new data and send them my outputs -->
- AFTER that, add stuff


# To Add
## Data Form

- add option for constant input (distribution)
- add option for deterministic, non-deterministic, and constant
  - change "saturated" dropdown to "configuration options" (or something like that. bad name tho)

## Display
- add log-normal distribution





# To Fix
- is backend working on first connextion? Is display collecting the current data or the previous data?

## Data Form
- split z into H_wt and z_step

## Display
- remove rv comp tab
- replace Z with distance from surface (H_wt - z_i)





# My thoughts
- get program to use ROUTES

## Data Form
- need to split or shrink so all Form is visible on one page. Shouldn't have to scroll on a normal screen

## Display
- show options[0] initially for graphs with dropdown
- fit table to screen and have in-table scroll

## If I have time

- make it look better visually bro
- make it work and see if I can deploy current build on heroku or something like it
  - if deploy, make homepage describing where i'm at now if not done

# If I have Time

if i have time
new graph for pdf for each rv (parameter)
